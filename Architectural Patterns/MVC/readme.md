## Model
* It consists of pure application logic, which interacts with the database. It includes all the information to represent data to the end user.

## View
* View represents the HTML files, which interact with the end user. It represents the model’s data to user.

## Controller
* It acts as an intermediary between view and model. It listens to the events triggered by view and queries model for the same.
