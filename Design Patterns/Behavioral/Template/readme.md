# Template Design Pattern
* Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations
    * and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes.
* The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm is preserved by the parent class.
* Template means Preset format like HTML templates which has fixed preset format.
* Similarly in template method pattern,we have a preset structure method called template method which consists of steps.
    * This steps can be abstract method which will be implemented by its subclasses.
* This behavioral design pattern is one of the easiest to understand and implement.
    * This design pattern is used popularly in framework development.
    * This helps to avoid code duplication also.
