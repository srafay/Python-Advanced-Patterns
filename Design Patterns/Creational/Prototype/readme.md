# Prototype Design Pattern
* Prototype design pattern helps to hide the complexity of the instances created by the class.
* The concept of the existing object will differ with that of the new object, which is created from scratch.
* The newly copied object may have some changes in the properties if required.
* This approach saves time and resources that go in for the development of a product.
