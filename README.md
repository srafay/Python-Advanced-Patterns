# Python-Advanced-Patterns
Design patterns are used to represent the pattern used by developers to create software or web application. These patterns are selected based on the requirement analysis. The patterns describe the solution to the problem, when and where to apply the solution and the consequences of the implementation.
* The patterns mostly used in Python are:
    * Architectural Patterns
    * Design Patterns
